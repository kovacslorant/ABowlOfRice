			<h1><i>Kung Pao Lajos's restaurant...</i></h1>
			<div class="introduction">
				<p><i>An authentic restaurant straight from Japan. The recipes of the famous Michelin-starred chef Lajos
					Kung Pao are given a modern look at the dishes of feudal Japan. They guide us on a culinary journey.
					The style of the time is mixed with the modern way of thinking, which was implemented under the
					personal supervision of Lajos when designing the restaurant. It's not just a meal, it's a trip
					straight back to medieval Japan, a memorable experience for the whole family.</i></p><br>
				<p><i>The Japanese are renowned for their precision and tradition, which can be seen in the dishes they
					prepare with great care and attention. Cooking for them, like many other things, is an art. Due to
					their island characteristics and isolation, their food is very exotic. These are the dishes that
					will end up on your table.</i></p>
